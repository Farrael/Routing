# Routing Solver
This program uses a wave algorithm to solve the routing problem.

##### How to :
 * Without argument : (not fully implemented)
   * Set the grid height and width
   * Define grid structure before running the algorithm
   

 * With argument :
   * Use the path to a structure file as argument
     ```shell
     ./Routing [path_to_file]
     ```
   * The file must contain a matrix of number separated by spaces (input.txt)
